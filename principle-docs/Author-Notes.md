- Even if in a political context "person" appears a related definition, the "user" definition is more correct for the general purpose base of the framework. Then, using the "person" definition create an implicit "exclusion principle" about who can use the platform (people).
- The abstraction fever and feature creep: for an already existing organization the less traumatic approach is a "messagging platform" that can extends itself in base of structure and staff requirements and capabilities. This "representative party web framework", instead, tends to "force too much" an organization to adapt to its vision. The conceptual reality it's in the middle: this frameworks should born to be basically a "messagging platform", a very basic social network with decentralized providers optional support, and then be able to extend itself throgh personalized but cohesive policies and extensions inside a provider and, overall, inside a "social network circle" (or "party circle" in political context)

- Remember to maintain the protocol concept: not only "shared data across providers", but also "possible shared client across providers" (especially in the same social-party circle-ring)

Go-ahead pre-cooked prompt:
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) 
Continue with other roadmap implementations (and improvements/fixes where needed) in source code in various contexts (UX, features, data management and P2P protocol etc...). Remember to update README.md

Check-back pre-cooked prompt:
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) 
Check current project and source code status and apply performances and redundancies optimizations on code and UX consistency. Then execute unit tests. Collect all possible future optimizations in file [OPTIMIZATIONS.md](OPTIMIZATIONS.md)


REMEMBER TODOs:
- Add data adapters for MySQL and MongoDB
- Add to the roadmap the optional "invisible user provider" option: seen that user ID are unique for an entire circle indipendently by their provider, can be possible allowing to hide the user's provider even for the provider through certain P2P protocols.
